Images in this folder are here just as an example.<br>
Paintings/partial paintings shown here were made by Vincent Van Gogh (I'm big fan of his work).<br>
Those golden frames around each image were made by me in photoshop - to imitate the 'Gallery Effect'.<br>
Yeah.. it looks not great but it is not bad either :/... I try to work within my skills limits here - right?
