 <h3 align="center"><b> Curved Grid Gallery </h3>
 <br><br>
This is a playground example of how images can be presented withing the two dimension limits of the browser.<br>
This gallery example is far from being finished, thus I would advise not to use it yet.<br><br><br>
<p align="center">There is a lot of work left to do (check <a href="https://github.com/rkruk/curved-grid-gallery/issues">issues</a>).<br><br>
  The gallery in current form is usable and it ~works - see <a href="https://rkruk.github.io/curved-grid-gallery/">EXAMPLE</a>.</p><br><br> 
The images, rows and columns are all over place. I also want to play a bit with the mobile device's view at some point in the future.
